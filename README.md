### Hi there 👋

I'm black_trees, a senior 1 student🧑🏻‍🎓 from Chengdu Foreign Languages School🏫.

You can also call me Miller(him) or Enonya(her)😊.

Sometimes I'll use these ID: `hylwxqwq`,`EnonyaBTe`,`BTe`,`BTeqwq`,`ReToZero`,`KonpakuYoumu`......

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Olympiad for Informatics🧑‍💻, and I'm working for my little goal——get a first prize🥇 in NOIp2023!
- ✨ My interests: computer science💻, touhou project⛩️, basketball🏀 and so on!
- 💖 My favorite characters: Yuyuko Saigyouji, Hecatia Lapislazuli, Satori Komeiji, NachoNeko, Nekoha Shizuku!
- (Actually I love all characters in touhou project :)

I'm a vimer, so maybe I will write some plugins for vim in my free time.

I'm willing to meet more friends who share the same interests as me🤗. I think it can be great fun!
